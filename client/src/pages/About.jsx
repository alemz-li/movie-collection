        <p>This website will show you my current physical media collection. It will display what movies I own and in which format I have it, it will also show below if I have marked that movie as seen. It allows to upload duplicate movie titles but what may differ is the format of the movie (in some cases it's a collectors edition).</p>
        <p>I started collecting physical media since 2014, the first movie that I remember buying was Kill Bill from director Quentin Tarantino in blu-ray format. The time that I watched it on my Xbox One S I was amazed of how good the quality of blu-ray was compared to DVD movies. That's when my passion of collecting phsyical media started.</p><p>What I mainly collect are essential movies highly acclaimed by ratings. I like horror and thriller movies.</p></article>
